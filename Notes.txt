GraphQL Intro:
===
GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.
It is an alternative to a REST API, with some added benefits such as the ability to request the exact data that you want.

In REST API, diffirent endpoints.
In GraphQL single endpoint. Response included ONLY the data asked for

Request/Query:
{
  client(id: "100") {
    name,
    client {
      name
    }
  }
}

Response:
{
  "data": {
    "project": {
      "name": "Mobile Application",
      "client": {
        "name": "Tony Stark"
      }
    }
  }
}


Mutation - used to add/update/delete data to server
mutation {
  addProject(
  name: "Mobile Application",
  description: "This is a description", status: "Not Started",
  clientId: "1" ) {
      name
      description
      status
   }
｝

Response:
{
  "data": {
    "addProject": {
      "name": "Mobile Application",
      "description": "This is a description",
      "status": "Not Started"
    }
  ｝
｝

GraphiQL Tool (like Postman for REST API)

Schemas & Types:
GraphQL servers have a "schema" that specifies all of the fields as well as their "types".
The most basic components of a GraphQL schema are object types,

Scalar Types Include:
String, Int, Float, Boolean, ID

Object Type:
type Project {
  name: String!
  description: String!,
  status: String!
}

Getting Started:
There are a lot of different technologies to chose from. There are also different methods for creating schemas, types, queries, etc

We will be using a package called express-graphql which is a GraphQL server for Node.js with tools to use with Express.
Apollo Server is another popular tool that you can use as well as some content management systems like Graph CMS to easily create a GraphQL API.
